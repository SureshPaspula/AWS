# AWS Tagging

### Why we need Tags?
### AWS Tagging Strategy
* I can say tags are real-time configuration DataBase(CMDB)
* For example we can easily identify what are your ec2 instance and running in which regoin, how many of them are running i PROD and how many are having snapshot backups and alerting all thes info can be gatherd, serched, indexedd using tags

  #### Tages for Cost Allocation
  * AWS Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Report support the ability to break down AWS costs by
tag. 
  * Typically, customers use business tags such as cost center, business unit, or project to
associate AWS costs with traditional financial reporting dimensions within their organization.
However, a cost allocation report can include any tag. 
  * This allows customers to easily associate
costs with technical or security dimensions, such as specific applications, environments, or
compliance programs.
